# Special Gear Results

These sims are meant to compare pieces with and without special effects to determine relative value of the effects themselves. All gear things are being compared to are mythic quality (445 ilvl) gear from Eternal Palace.

For the Benthic gear, there are two sets of sims for each item: `Inactive` and `Active`. The `Inactive` sets might show negative DPS, because they are just 425 ilvl in comparison to the current 445 equipped gear as a base. Some of the effects `Active` profile will actually be above the baseline, meaning that the proc is worth at least 20 ilvls. Currently none of these sims have sockets, which can also add a hefty amount of DPS, check out the [consumables sims](https://github.com/WarcraftPriests/bfa-shadow-priest/blob/master/consumables/README.md) for how much sockets are worth. If you notice that an `Active` sim is equal or less than its `Inactive` part, this means that the effect is not yet implemented into SimC.
